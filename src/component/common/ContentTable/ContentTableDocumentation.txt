in this component the defualt assumptions is that all the arrays in array contains same keys, so there is no worry to check this.
The fact is I believe that this should be checked for consistancy, but anyway for now i skip it.
hint: I realised thta there is a library called lodash wich can be usefull to check. e.g:
    // to check if all object in array contains same keys
	  const hasSameKeys = (arrOfObjects) => {
		const _ = require("lodash");
		let isEqual = true;
		arrOfObjects.forEach((eachObj) => {
			if (!_.isEqual(arrOfObjects[0], eachObj)) {
				isEqual = false;
			}
		});
